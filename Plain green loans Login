Every payday loan customer has a checking account at a bank or credit union because it is a loan requirement. Most customers would prefer borrowing from their bank or credit union instead of a payday lender as long as they were equally likely to be approved, but they cannot do so because regulatory uncertainty has made it difficult for banks and credit unions to issue small loans. Many financial institutions have expressed an interest in offering lower-cost, small-dollar credit to their customers who use payday loans, but only if they receive clear regulatory guidance that enables them to do so with simple underwriting.
Banks and credit unions could offer five-month loans of $500 for a $125 fee under a 5 percent payment option, which borrowers say compare favorably to the $500 loans with $750 fees that payday lenders would be likely to issue under the proposed ATR provision. Unless the proposed regulations are modified, high-cost loans are the only ones likely to be widely available.
